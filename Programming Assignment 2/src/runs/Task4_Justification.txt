It is not possible to implement the ability to change the number of philosphers in the middle of the task due to the complications and risks it brings. Since the the dining philosphers handles the creation of philosophers' spaces, the theoretical implementation requires a dynamic data structure to handle a variable number of philopshers ( so a list instead of an array ) but this would cause us to dynamically change the number of chopsticks as well which may lead to logical errors, for example, assume we have 5 philosophers where philopshers 1 and 4 are eating, if philospher 5 walks out, then we get 2 adjacent philosophers that are eating at the same time, which violates synchronization implemented in the monitor.
